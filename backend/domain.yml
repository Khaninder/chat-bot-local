  utter_negative_panas:
  - text: Good! It's great to hear that. I noticed you indicated that you were feeling
      some negative emotions on your questionnaire earlier. Are you still feeling
      that way?
  utter_ask_why_bad:
  - text: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling that way. Would you like to tell me more about it?
  utter_happy_offer_chat:
  - text: Good! It's great to hear that. Soon, we'll play a quick game, but we can
      chat a bit first, if you'd like. If there are any problems or stressors you'd
      like to vent about, you have the opportunity to do so now. Is there anything
      you'd like to talk to me about?
  utter_denied_chat:
  - text: Okay. Lots of us have stressors that may not always be on our minds, but
      when we are thinking about them, they can really bring about some negative feelings.
      I'd like to show you a simple technique that can help you manage your negative
      emotions when they do come up.
  utter_goodbye:
  - text: Bye
  utter_denied_why_bad:
  - text: Are you sure? Sometimes it can feel good to get it off your chest. However,
      if you don't feel comfortable talking about it right now, I can just share some
      ideas to help you feel better.
  utter_venting_group:
  - text: I'm glad to hear that you feel comfortable telling me about it. You can
      go ahead and tell me about what's been going on. You can tell me more about
      the way you're feeling and why.
